Communicator watch built for 2016 Bring-a-Hack (end of Bay Area Maker Faire Weekend).

This is based on the stalled [SloJak](https://github.com/szczys/SloJak) project. It is a 128x64 OLED screen with a rotary encoder and two buttons (actually 3 with encoder click but that's not designed into the board artwork).

Two things prevent this watch from communicating: I would need a second one to communicate with, and I didn't include the 900 MHz radio module in the design. This is just a quick and dirty built.

To make up for the lack of actual communications I will write KnobSnake, a classic game of snake that's played only by spinning the rotary encoder knob.
